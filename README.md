Game starts automatically.  To restart the game, refresh the browser.

## Object of the Game
The object of the game is to get your character to cross from the bottom of the screen
to the top of the screen without colliding with anything.

## How to Move
You use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move.  You are not allowed to move your character
off the game board.  Attempts at illegal moves are ignored. Once you reach the top row, press
the up arrow to get credit for crossing and reset your character to the starting row for another
try.

## Collisions
If your character collides with another entity, it will be reset to the starting position and
no points are scored.
